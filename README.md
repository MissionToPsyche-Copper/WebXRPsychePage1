# WebXRPsychePage1
Experience Name: Psyche Exploration XR Webpage
Capstone Student: Micah Schmidt
Capstone Class: CSE 485/486 Capstone
Date: Fall 2021/Spring 2022
Sponsor: Cassie Bowman

Project Summary:
    The project intention is to create a mobile experience using WebXR for the NASA Psyche mission. The project is meant to increase public engagement with Psyche mission concepts. The webpage is accessible and usable for any modern devices. 
    This webpage is a minigame to allow the user to view and explore the asteroid Psyche. The user can rotate the camera around the asteroid and discover blue points of interest to view more about Psyche.

Development Details:
    The project was made using WebXR on the AFrame framework. AFrame is a framework for creating extended reality web applications.

Frameworks and packages Used:
    Aframe: https://aframe.io/
    Aframe-orbit: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-orbit-controls
    Aframe-gui: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-gui

Running the app:
    The experience starts at the index.html file. This is the page the user should first be redirected to. All accompanied JS and CSS files are required, as well are the assets and fonts folders. The folder "PsycheInformativeWebpage" is for development and can be ignored.

Small Improvements:
    If time permits, I can research implementing the following:
    1. Blue points change color when clicked for visual progress through experience.
    2. Fade in Play Button and Credits Button rather than just appearing.
    3. Redo blue point primitive and implement gui as modals.
    4. Gyroscope/AR toggle.
    5. Reward for clicking all blue points.
